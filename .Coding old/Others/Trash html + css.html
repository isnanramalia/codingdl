      <p id="texs_fighting"><b>I hope someday i can become an expert programmer, definitely can!</b> </p>
      <p id="text_panjang"> I want to tell a little about why I am interested in coding, actually there is no clear reason why, but in the past I could indeed repair simple electronic items besides that I also felt superior to my friends about technology such as the use of smartphones.
      <p id="text_panjang">I am an introvert, it may be because of my physical condition or environment as well as because I am a person who is really insecure about other people.Long story short, when I was in grade 10 to 11 there was a pandemic season that required me to go to school online from home, at the beginning when it was implemented I had a lot of difficulty adapting, there were even some things I still couldn't handle. But I am very lucky because if there is no pandemic season or where I have to be at home, maybe I don't have a dream to study at the Bandung Institute of Technology, I don't have any goals for the future.</p>
      <p id="text_panjang">Masyaallah I'm grateful that I can get a lot of motivation from Ruangguru and many others too. Day by day I think about my dream, from that process there is a lot of confusion, whether I don't have much preferences, don't have much experience, don't know what my own talent is, still can't master mathematics. In the process I found a very valuable free website which is Coding School, I studied a little bit but stopped because I wanted to focus on school lessons. Today is 12/15/2020 I'm writing this because this is the beginning of my dream.</p>

     <p> <b>I can do it</b> <em> I want little story about myself, I born in Kendal,Central Java, Indonesia. Yeah, you right i live in a country that is still underdveloped, i'm often thinking about this country still very bad but sometimes too i think this country actually very good, very beutifull, but i feel Indonesia can't take advantage of that advantage yet. </em></p>
     <p><i>  I just hope Indonesian can become a developed counntry with diversity today. I hope i can contribute work and anything for a sake of advancing Indonesia. </i> </p>
