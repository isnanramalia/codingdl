        Halo! I don't know what to say, but maybe I can write about my family. I don't know why I often feel that my family is toxic because there are often debates and different perspectives besides that there is a lack of finances. Almost all of the burdens of my mind are filled with family problems. My emotions often go out of control when there is treatment or harsh words. Honestly this is difficult, many things are less supported by the circumstances of the parents. I can only hope that it is given the convenience of achieving ease in life so that it can be successful and useful for many people.
        <p>of all that I am very grateful for all sufficiency and whatever I have right now. I hope that every day I can be more grateful with whatever I have.</p>
      </br>
